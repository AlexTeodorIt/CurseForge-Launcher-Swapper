# CurseForge-Launcher-Swapper

This app swaps the default Minecraft Launcher to SKLauncher, allowing players to play modpacks offline.
it's very easy to use.

When you start the file you should start it with ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES.

The first start will be slower than others, cause it will check if you installed it before, it downloads its files at the first start (or when you wipe %temp%), after that it should start immediately when you open it.
