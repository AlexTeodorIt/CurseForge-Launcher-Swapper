# CurseForge-Launcher-Swapper

This app swaps the default Minecraft Launcher to SKLauncher, allowing players to play modpacks offline.
it's very easy to use.

When you start the file you should start it with ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES.

The first start will be slower than others, cause it will check if you installed it before, it downloads its files at the first start (or when you wipe %temp%), after that it should start immediately when you open it.

!!! If you don't have CurseForge installed, you can install it by pressing the third button. After you install it you need to go in minecraft section and wait for it to load (you let it load till you can browse all the modpacks) !!!

Firstly you need to download the SKLauncher, by pressing the first button. When it dowloaded, an popup should appear saying "SKLauncher has been successfully downloaded !".
To swap the Original Minecraft launcher to SKLauncher you need to press the second button.
After you do all of that you need to run or install a modpack, you login into it (with Microsoft Account or in Offline Mode).

I hope i helped someone, much love from Al3xutzu <3
